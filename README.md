# Obsidian
Typical files you would find in an `.obsidian` folder in an Obsidian vault. I configured my preferred color scheme and editing mode.

## Setup
```bash
# Navigate to your vault folder
cd /path/to/your/obsidian/vault
# Delete the previous .obsidian folder
rm -r .obsidian
# Clone this repo as the new .obsidian for your vault
git clone https://github.com/slidingsoul/obsidian.git .obsidian
```
